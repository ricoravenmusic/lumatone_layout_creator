1. Download the file `create_layout.py` to the directory where your lumatone layouts (`.ltn` files) are stored.
2. Run the command
    ```console
    python create_layout.py
    ```
   in a terminal in the same directory (requires an installation of python). 

Note colors can be changed directly within the source code in `create_layout.py`.
